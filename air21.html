        <p><strong>Security Testing & Evaluation:</strong> Conducted nationwide security drills and stress tests to assess the effectiveness of implemented security plans. Recommended enhancements based on observed gaps and emerging security trends.</p>
        <p><strong>Incident Management:</strong> Developed a Mobile Incident Report Response Form that would immediately deliver the details ahead of time to the operations team and come with an urgent temporary and or permanent resolution</p>
        <p><strong>Stakeholder & Government Liaison:</strong> Established and maintained strong partnerships with government agencies, emergency responders, intelligence networks, and law enforcement to enhance security intelligence and crisis response capabilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Fraud & Asset Protection Investigations:</strong> Led internal investigations into incidents of fraud, theft, and other security breaches that posed a risk to company assets and financial interests.
